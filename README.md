# DDT Standards

This repository contains **public standards-track proposals and specifications** for Digital Double Technologies (DDT).

DDT is a non-enforcing, informational system for binding creator-declared consent and identity context to media using C2PA / Content Credentials.

## Non-Enforcement Posture (Core)

DDT standards are **informational only**.

They MUST NOT be used for:
- moderation
- ranking
- suppression
- enforcement
- takedowns
- behavioral or policy decisions

DDT expresses declared consent and usage visibility, not compliance, legality, or obligation.

## What Lives Here

- Draft specifications (v0.x)
- Public proposals and discussion issues
- Non-enforcement and platform-safety clarifications
- C2PA-aligned extension exploration (consent/rights visibility)

## What Does NOT Live Here

- Private implementations
- Internal automation outputs
- Sensitive operational details
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Legal determinations

## Structure

- `docs/` — specifications and public explainers
- `proposals/` — proposal drafts and supporting materials
- `specs/README.md` - standards-track specifications and schemas
