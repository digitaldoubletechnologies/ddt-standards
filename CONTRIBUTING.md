# Contributing

DDT Standards welcomes constructive collaboration.

## Scope

This repository contains:
- public standards-track drafts (v0.x)
- proposals and discussion issues
- non-enforcement and platform-safety clarification documents

It does not contain enforcement mechanisms or legal determinations.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue with:
   - the problem
   - proposed change
   - rationale
   - any risks or ambiguity

2. If proposing spec edits:
   - keep semantics conservative
   - include explicit “non-meaning” sections
   - preserve non-enforcement posture

## Non-enforcement doctrine (non-negotiable)

DDT standards are informational only and MUST NOT be used for:
moderation, ranking, suppression, enforcement, takedowns, or behavioral decisions.
