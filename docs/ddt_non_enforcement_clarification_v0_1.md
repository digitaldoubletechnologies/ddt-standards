# What DDT Does NOT Do

This document clarifies the **explicit boundaries**
of Digital Double Technologies (DDT).

DDT is a standards and metadata initiative.
It is **not** an enforcement system.

---

## DDT Does NOT Enforce Anything

DDT does not:
- enforce rules
- compel behavior
- block content
- remove content
- restrict distribution

DDT provides **information only**.

---

## DDT Does NOT Moderate or Rank Content

DDT does not:
- moderate platforms
- rank or suppress media
- influence recommendations
- affect visibility or reach

DDT signals are **not inputs to algorithms**.

---

## DDT Does NOT Perform Takedowns

DDT does not:
- issue takedown requests
- initiate copyright claims
- trigger platform actions

Any response to DDT signals is the sole decision
of platforms, users, or legal authorities.

---

## DDT Does NOT Make Legal Determinations

DDT does not:
- determine legality
- adjudicate disputes
- interpret contracts
- override jurisdictional law

DDT expresses **declared consent state**, not legal conclusions.

---

## What DDT Actually Does

DDT:
- provides standardized metadata
- preserves declared consent visibility
- improves auditability
- reduces ambiguity
- supports transparency

This posture is aligned with
non-enforcing standards such as C2PA.

---

## Why This Matters

Clear boundaries protect:
- creators
- platforms
- unions
- audiences

DDT’s value comes from **restraint**, not control.
