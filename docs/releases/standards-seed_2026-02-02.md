# DDT Standards Seed — 2026-02-02

This repository establishes the initial public standards surface for Digital Double Technologies (DDT).

## What was published

1. **Non-Enforcement Clarification (v0.1)**
   - A plain-language statement of what DDT does NOT do.
   - Written to be platform-safe and union-safe.

2. **C2PA Performer Consent Extension (v0.1 Skeleton)**
   - A conservative spec skeleton for visibility-only consent/rights signals.
   - Explicitly non-enforcing and privacy-preserving.

3. **Public Proposal Issue**
   - A timestamped invitation for collaboration with standards contributors and implementers.

## Why this matters

- Establishes shared vocabulary before proprietary fragmentation
- Creates a public audit trail for standards lineage
- Aligns with provenance ecosystems while preserving non-enforcement posture

## Posture

DDT standards are informational only and MUST NOT be used for moderation, ranking, enforcement, takedowns, or behavioral decisions.

## Next steps

- Iterate claim semantics with conservative “non-meaning” language
- Add example C2PA manifests for core scenarios
- Prepare submission memo for C2PA Technical Working Group review
