# DDT-016 — Detection & Exposure Layer (Informational Only)

**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Posture:** Informational / Non-Enforcing  

---

## Purpose

Define how DDT signals may be detected and surfaced in a manner that is platform-safe and non-enforcing.

---

## Platform-Safe Constraint (Non-Negotiable Doctrine)

DDT signals are **informational only** and MUST NOT be used for:
- moderation
- ranking
- suppression
- enforcement
- takedowns
- behavioral or policy decisions

DDT expresses declared consent and usage visibility,
not compliance, legality, or obligation.

Any use of DDT signals for enforcement or platform action
is explicitly out of scope and non-compliant with DDT doctrine.
